As part of my internship at Octanet Pvt Ltd in web development, I have developed a To-Do List web application. This application allows users to organize and manage their tasks effectively. Users can easily add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete completed tasks.I have used simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design this.
